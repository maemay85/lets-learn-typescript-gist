# let's learn typescript!

### 1. Find or clone a new copy of the Pixelate solution code

  >> Here is a link: [pixelate](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/PairExercise.Pixelate.Solution)

### 2. npm install, then npm start to check for bugz

### 3. install Typescript 

like so: 
    
    npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
    
### 4. Create the tsconfig.json file in your root directory. 
    
  >> the best way to do this is: 
        
       npx tsc --init
    
  >> You should now have a tsconfig.json file that may or may not look angry, and has a bunch of commented out code. hooray.
    
 ### 5. Now it's time to get juicy! 
 
  We're going to convert TableRow.js TableColumn.js and Table.js to typescript,
